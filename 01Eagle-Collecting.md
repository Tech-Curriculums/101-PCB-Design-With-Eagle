Eagle Collecting
================

Gotta catch... more libraries I say.

In this section we'll go over adding libraries to Eagle
from Github.

## Adafruit and Sparkfun libraries

Because more parts make your Eagle more awesome.

**First go to the following site and click on "Download as Zip":**

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library

Afterwards open the Eagle folder and place the `.lbr` file from the 
Adafruit zip folder into your Eagle Folder's `lbr` directory.
(you'll know it's the one if there are lots of existing `.lbr` files there)

===

**Second go to the following site and click on "Download as Zip":**
https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries

Sparkfun keeps their files as separate `.lbr` files, after extracting, again place
all of the Sparkfun lbr's into your Eagle's `lbr` folder.
