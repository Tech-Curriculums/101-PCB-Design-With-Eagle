101-PCB-Design-With-Eagle
=========================

Eagle is a favorite in the hacker/maker community, and
since the community is really good, you can bet that
you can find 100's of tutorials of anything you would like to
do online.

In this course, we condense the best of these tutorials into 
3 sessions teaching you to make your own boards.

Afterwards you can team up with someone from the web-design course to
create a store, from our fabrication courses to create an enclosure,
or even directly sell your PCB's on websites like Etsy.
